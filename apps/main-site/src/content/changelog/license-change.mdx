description: We're still open source, but we're moving to a modified MIT license that limits hosting Answer Overflow as a service.

It's too often that we see open source projects which have their business model around hosting their software as a service get taken advantage of by large companies forking their code. I strongly belive in keeping Answer Overflow open source, but I also want to make sure that we're developing software in a sustainable way that allows us to support ourselves. That's why we're moving to a modified MIT license with the only limitation being not allowing to host Answer Overflow as a service, self-hosting it is still completely allowed.

Hopefully you understand our decision, if this limits anyone from using the source of Answer Overflow for legitimate reasons, please reach out to us and we'll see what we can do about granting exceptions to the license.
